Lua Script Primer
=================

|rezonator| uses `Lua <http://www.lua.org>`_ internally to calculate custom formulas. Here are some citations from the `original documentation <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/>`_ to get a brief intro into the language. Provided information should be sufficient to write formulas for :ref:`schema parameters <params_window>` or to carry out calculations in :doc:`calc_formula`.

Lua is a free-form language. It ignores spaces (including newlines) and comments between lexical elements (tokens), except as delimiters between names and keywords. 


Variables
---------

Variables are places that store values.

Lua is a case-sensitive language: ``and`` is a reserved word, but ``And`` and ``AND`` are two different, valid names.    

The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:
``and``, ``break``, ``do``, ``else``, ``elseif``, ``end``,
``false``, ``for``, ``function``, ``goto``, ``if``, ``in``,
``local``, ``nil``, ``not``, ``or``, ``repeat``, ``return``,
``then``, ``true``, ``until``, ``while``.

A numeric value can be written with an optional fractional part and an optional decimal exponent, marked by a letter ``e`` or ``E``.  Examples of valid values are ``3``, ``3.1416``, ``314.16e-2``, ``0.31416E1``, ``34e1``

Lua allows multiple assignments::

    x, y = 10, 20
    x, y, z = y, z, x


Operators
---------

Lua supports the following arithmetic operators:

``+`` --- addition

``-`` --- subtraction

``*`` --- multiplication

``/`` --- float division

``//`` --- floor division

``%`` --- modulo (remainder of a division that rounds the quotient towards minus infinity)

``^`` --- exponentiation (it works for non-integer exponents too)

``-`` --- unary minus

Lua supports the following relational operators:

``==`` --- equality

``~=`` --- inequality

``<`` --- less than

``>`` --- greater than

``<=`` --- less or equal

``>=`` --- greater or equal


Comments
--------

A comment starts with a double hyphen (``--``) and runs until the end of the line. 

    
Mathematical Functions
----------------------

Lua provides a set of `mathematical functions <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.7>`_ in the ``math`` library. One has to call them using the library name, e.g., ``math.sin(math.pi / 4)``. For convenience, |rezonator| supports its own set of standard mathematical functions that can be used without any additional prefix, e.g., ``sin(pi()/4)``. 

``sin`` --- returns the sine of the angle in radians.

``sinh`` --- returns the hyperbolic sine of the argument.

``asin`` --- returns the arcsine of the argument as an angle in radians.

``cos`` --- returns the cosine of the angle in radians.

``cosh`` --- returns the hyperbolic cosine of the argument.

``acos`` --- returns the arccosine of the argument as an angle in radians.

``tan`` --- returns the tangent of the angle in radians.

``tanh`` --- returns the hyperbolic tangent of the argument.

``atan`` --- returns the arctangent of the argument as an angle in radians.

``cot`` --- returns the cotangent of the angle in radians.

``coth`` --- returns the hyperbolic cotangent of the argument.

``acot`` --- returns the arccotangent of the argument as an angle in radians.

``sec`` --- returns the secant of the angle in radians.

``sech`` --- returns the hyperbolic secant of the argument.

``csc`` --- returns the cosecant of the angle in radians.

``csch`` --- returns the hyperbolic cosecant of the argument.

``abs`` --- returns the absolute value of the argument.

``floor`` --- returns the largest integer that is not greater than the argument. For example, ``floor(41.2) = 41``.

``ceil`` --- returns the smallest integer that is not less than the argument. For example, ``ceil(41.2) = 42``.

``exp`` --- returns the value of `e` to the power of the argument, where `e` is the base of natural logarithms.

``ln`` --- returns the natural logarithm of the argument. Natural logarithm uses base `e`.

``lg`` --- returns the logarithm of the argument in base 10.

``sqrt`` --- returns the square root of the argument.

``deg2rad`` --- converts the angle from degrees to radians.

``rad2deg`` --- converts the angle from radians to degrees.

``pi`` --- returns value `Ï€`.
