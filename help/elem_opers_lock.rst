Disable/Enable
==============

:menuSelection:`Element --> Disable/Enable`

The command toggles the :ref:`enabled flag <elem_props_lock>` of one or several elements. The main purpose of having this as a separate command is to quickly switch an element type. For example, you can create two elements and disable one of them. Then select both elements and hit the command, the element change their states simultaneously - that one that has been disabled gets enabled and the second one gets disabled. This allows for quick switching between element and checking what changes.
