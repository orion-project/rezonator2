Spherical Mirror
================

The spherical mirror has the same radii of curvature `R` for both tangential and sagittal planes. Matrices for both planes are equal too when the beam falls on the mirror at the normal angle. When the incident beam is inclined at angle `α`, then the matrices for the T and S planes differ. 

A spherical mirror can be concave or convex depending on the sign of the radius of curvature. The sign of ROC is not related to the beam :ref:`propagation direction <propagation_dir>` but only governs how the mirror transforms the beam’s wavefront. 

The spherical mirror acts in the same way as a :doc:`thin lens <ElemThinLens>`, except that you have to specify the radius of curvature instead of the focal range. Even on the :ref:`layout <layout>`,  it is displayed as a lens when it is not located at the ends of the optical system.
