Flat Mirror
===========

The flat mirror has a unity matrix and does not affect the propagating beam. It still is an essential  element for :doc:`round-trip matrix calculation <../round_trip_matrix>` when placed at the end of the resonator.

The flat mirror changes its representation on the :ref:`layout <layout>` when it does not locate at the end of the resonator. Similar to :doc:`ElemPoint`, you can use it as a helper element, e.g., as a separator between two adjacent range elements having different semantics.
