Tangential Cylindrical Thin Lens
================================

The tangential cylindrical lens acts just like a general :doc:`thin lens <ElemThinLens>` but transforms a beam only in the :ref:`tangential plane <working_planes>`. In the other, plane it has a unity matrix and does not affect the beam.
