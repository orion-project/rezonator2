Brewster Plane-parallel Plate
=============================

Brewster plate is characterized by its thickness `L` and index of refraction `n`. A beam falls at the face of the plate at Brewster's angle.

Like :doc:`ElemBrewsterCrystal`, it is also a widely used form of laser gain medium. However, when the laser rod becomes too short, it is convenient to consider it as a plane-parallel plate which is tilted at Brewster's angle toward the beam propagation. In this case, the geometric path of the beam `L`\ :sub:`eff` is slightly bigger than the thickness of the element.
