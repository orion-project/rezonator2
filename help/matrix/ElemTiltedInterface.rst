Tilted Interface
================

.. |n1| replace:: `n`\ :sub:`1`
.. |n2| replace:: `n`\ :sub:`2`

The element represents the flat boundary between two media having indexes of refraction |n1| and |n2|. Then the incident angle of the beam is set via the element's parameter `α`.

It is sometimes convenient to set the angle inside the |n2| media as if one would want to set `β` angle instead of `α`. However, there is no additional `β` parameter in the element, as it leads to ambiguity what angle should be considered. Instead, one can give the negative sign to the angle, and it forces |rezonator| to treat this angle as being inside of the |n2| media and calculate the first angle accordingly.

.. warning::

    The left and the right adjacent elements of an interface element should be either :doc:`ElemEmptyRange` or :doc:`ElemMediaRange`. |rezonator| doesn't complain if they are not, but you can get incorrect results.
