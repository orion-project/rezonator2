Point Element
=============

The point element is a helper element having a unity matrix. It does not affect propagating beam anyhow. The element differs from :doc:`ElemFlatMirror` only in visual representation but the same in calculations.

For example, one can use this element as a separator between two adjacent range elements with different semantic and then change the value of ranges independently.
