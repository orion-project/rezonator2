Brewster Plane-parallel Crystal
===============================

Brewster crystal is characterized by its length `L` and index of refraction `n`. A beam falls at the face of the crystal at Brewster's angle. Element's length is measured along the beam path. 

One can consider this element as a rod whose opposite ends are cut at Brewster's angle. It is a widely used form of laser gain medium.
