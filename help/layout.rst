Layout
======

Schema layout is an automatically formed schematic representation of the schema in linear view, i.e., all bends and folds of the optical axis are ignored and elements are displayed in one line.

Here is the layout for the “z_crystal” example. It shows how the Z-shaped resonator is unwrapped into the linear view:

Each element type has its own representation on the layout. Note that spherical mirrors are displayed as lenses if they are not placed at the schema's ends. If a beam falls angularly onto a mirror or a lens, the corresponding element is displayed inclined on the layout to indicate that the system is astigmatic.

TODO: layout is interactive, the same commands as in element list

TODO: locked are not displayed

TODO: different element views - labels, narrow
