Symbols in Table Window
=======================

There are cases when several values of the same parameter correspond to one element in the table.

For example:

* The beam radius in the tangential plane and radius of wavefront curvature in both planes are different for points lying at the crystalâ€™s edge inside and outside the medium. 

* Beam parameters for each side and for the middle of the crystal (`z = 0`, `z = L/2` and `z = L` where `z` is the coordinate along the optical axis) are calculated separately. 

* The radius of wavefront curvature can be different for beams incident to a curve mirror or a lens and for the reflected or refracted beam.

Certain elements have more than one corresponding row in the data table for these cases. Every such row is marked with a special icon.

When you invoke the :menuSelection:`Copy` command via the :menuSelection:`Edit` menu or context menu of the table, the content of selected cells is copied into the clipboard as text. Row icons are also copied in the text form.
