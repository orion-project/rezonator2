Table Window
============

Results of calculations of certain functions are represented as a data table in a special table window. E.g. :doc:`func_beamdata`. Cells in the table can show combined results for T and S planes or only one plane. Precision of values presentation in the table is controlled by the :ref:`application settings <app_settings_format_precision>`.

The table window provides features for:

- :ref:`Freezing <table_opers_freeze>` the calculated data
- :ref:`Choosing<table_opers_units>` different units of measurement for each column
- :ref:`Viewing <table_opers_show_t>` combined or separate results for T and S planes
- :ref:`Copying <table_opers_copy>` data to clipboard
