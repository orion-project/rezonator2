Elements Catalog
================

:menuSelection:`Element --> Append`

  .. image:: img/catalog.png

The Elements Catalog window contains an element types list divided into categories like "Common", "Interfaces", and so forth. Each element type has its own small schematic image (an icon) intended to identify the type of particular element in the schema :ref:`elements list <schema_elems>`. Furthermore, each element type has a large outline image used as the reference information to display the meaning of the element parameters.

.. _catalog_custom_lib:

Custom library
--------------

There could also be the "Custom library" tab in the Catalog dialog showing a list of element presets with preassigned parameters. They can be added to the schema as usual. A copy of the preset is added to the schema, and all parameter values get assigned to the target element. The label of the preset is used as the *label prefix* for the new elements (see :ref:`elem_props_label`, :ref:`app_settings_gen_labels_created`). Use the :doc:`elem_library` window for managing the presets.
